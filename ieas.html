    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>The Institute started in the year 2012 and it was named Institute of Computer Studies and Tourism. It was primarily established as a response to the market demands and attune to the needs of the Clark Freeport Zone and other employers in the city, thus assuring a better chance at employment.  More importantly, as productive members of the community with a higher sense of dignity.
        The initial program offerings are the Associate Degree in Computer Science, Associate Degree in Information Systems and Associate Degree in Tourism Management. All these courses are two-year courses and registered under the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA). After a year, the institute applied for Government Authority from the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) to elevate the associate degrees to bachelor’s degree; and by virtue of Government Authority in accordance with the pertinent provisions of “Higher Education Act of 1994,” the City College of Angeles was authorized to operate Bachelor Degree courses effective in the Academic Year 2013-2014 for the following programs: BS in Computer Science, BS in Information Systems and BS in Tourism Management. As for the two year-courses, they were no longer continued, except for the Associate in Computer Science which was changed to Associate in Computer Technology.
        In the Academic Year 2014-2015, an additional program was added which is the Bachelor of Library and Information Science, however, in the same year the BS in Tourism Management separated to another institute which is the Institute of Business and Management. From then the institute name has change to the Institute of Computing Studies and Library Information Science (ICSLIS).
        The institute have produced six batches of graduates in BS in Computer Science and BS in Information Systems and four batches under the Bachelor of Library and Information Science program.
        The institute has subjected itself and its three programs for institutional sustainability assessment and ALCUCOA accreditation where it initially passed the candidate status for its three program offerings and is now eyeing to have the Level I ALCUCOA Accreditation this 2022.</p>
